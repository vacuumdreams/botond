Since I have applied to more, than 500 jobs in the past few months, this is pretty much the next obvious topic. I really don't have the scientific method to assess this, and since a lot of variables changed in my life since my last proper job hunt, it is hard to compare experiences, but it does feel like the world of HR shot itself in the balls while I was not looking. As Vsauce would say, "Or did it?" ** the music is already playing in your head, isn't it? **

### The crime scene

Let's see what do we have here. We have Mr. HR with bleeding testicles and a gunshot injury, as we established (going with the mister here, gracefully ignoring my growing anxiety about stepping on the toes of the gender police).

Covid Jr. is laying half-dead on the floor, having received multiple bullet wounds from everyone. Maybe this is his revenge?

We've got Miss AI, a young prodigy who is eager for parental recognition and would do anything to find herself real purpose (yes, I just watched [Bullet Train](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt12593682/) last night, what can I say).

Then we have Mr. Economy, the father of Miss AI and the leader of the largest known organisation in the world, who's now on and suspected of committing some of the most devastating crimes known. Was it him, again?

Corporation, the big black hound of Mr. Economy is peacefully snoring in the corner, but we all know it would do anything to protect its master. It could be a bite, not a bullet, but it's hard to tell from this angle.

And I am there, too, a sleepwalking butterfly, causing ripples in the wind, carefree as I get. Did I do it? Now I'm worried, maybe my balls are bleeding, too, but my overfed stomack on the crumbles of blockchain startups is covering the view, I can't even see them anymore.

Now that I made you picture my balls, I say let's move on to the real deal.

### What changed?

A lot changed, it seems. When we moved to Lisbon with my partner in early 2022, the job market was booming. On the summer of 2023, my contract with a client had ended. Let's talk personal statistics: before, I would receive 4-5 interviews and about 3 offers for ~15 applications. In this new reality, I've quickly come to realize that I get 1 interview for every ~150 applications. I'm not exaggerating. Anyways, Copilot is telling my to continue with "I'm not here to complain, I'm here to understand". Totally, dude, I'm using that. That was my long run of "AI-less asylum". This is what happens when your IDE becomes your second home.

The nutshell version is that I feel like the tech industry grew to be a lot more unforgiving than it used to be. As an example I can state one of my last interviews for a full stack position, where I was on a one hour tech call with two backend devs, whiteboarding a system of microservices, discussing high level data structures and so on. Towards the end they asked me to write an SQL query with a LEFT JOIN. I totally froze. I did not write raw SQL probably since [this beauty](https://github.com/vacuumdreams/test_waypoints/blob/main/api/db/waypoints.go), which was my take home task for a previous job application, and for which I later on got the feedback that this part of my code was a big no-no when reviewing it, and every normal person would just use an ORM. Which I totally agree with. Cutting corners, huh? It must be so satisfying to label someone based on the full blown project you gave them to write in just a day or two, isn't it? Anyway, I never wrote a go service from scratch before, and I got the job in the end, too, so I was very proud of myself back then. These days I use prisma or more recently drizzle for everything, so as I was sitting there with a building cumulonimbus of emotions. Unfortunately I'm not the person who shrugs off non-sense easily when I'm expected to perform, I'd normally just look it up and be done with it, but I guess I ended up being that dev who does things for 10 years and still can't do basics. Of course, I didn't get the job, which might be for the best. It is funny to think back how much of an opposite this is with me interviewing for a backend gig 8 years ago, without any backend experience, expected to migrate a custom ORM from one database I had superficial experience with to another one I have never heard of in my life, and getting the job because "it's okay, you know stuff, we like you, you'll learn quickly" - which was exactly what happened.

It seems like job portals are sprouting everywhere I look, offering the next revolutionary life changing solution. It makes you assume the system is quite broken, doesn't it? Well, I've started registering everywhere. I'm going to share my experiences about them, because by now you're probably wondering where the hell is this going.

### Portals I liked

<Accordion type="single" collapsible>
<AccordionItem value="cord">
<AccordionTrigger>
<div className="flex items-center gap-2 mb-2 mt-4"><MdxAvatar src="https://assets.co-hire.com/react/p/cord-icon-180.png" name="Cord" /><span>Cord</span></div>
</AccordionTrigger>
<AccordionContent className="text-lg">
<a href="https://cord.co" target="_blank" className="flex gap-2 items-center my-4"><ExternalLinkIcon /><span>Website</span></a>

If I have to choose a favorite job portal, it's probably going to be this one. [This is me](https://cord.co/candidate/account/u/candidate/230366).

**Pros**

- simple and easy to understand platform
- most jobs are remote
- many jobs have salary ranges
- transparency on how many people hear back from the company, and on how many people applied, which is great as a candidate
- focused on direct messaging, where the application process feels a bit more human, which results in improved feedback loops
- filling out all the profile info is usually the most tedious part in registering somewhere new, here the good UI and seamless flow eases the weight, and it compensates you with a relatively pretty downloadable PDF version which you can use as your CV.
- they organize online tech meetups occasionally

**Cons**

- not a lot of jobs usually

<AccordionContent className="text-lg">
<a href="https://otta.com" target="_blank" className="flex gap-2 items-center my-4"><ExternalLinkIcon /><span>Website</span></a>

I really wanted to like this platform because it looks great, and it has a great UX. I'm not sure if people get jobs on it, I never gotten a single reply for my ~20 applications, if I remember correctly.

**Pros**

- most jobs are remote
- many jobs have salary ranges
- relatively good design and user experience, easy to understand platform
- insights on what to expect in terms of how many people hear back from a company, glassdoor ratings, company funding status, etc
- downloadable PDF version of your profile

**Cons**

- no information on when a job posts were created
- lots of old job postings floating around for months, no transparency on what goes on in the background - I personally never heard back from any company I applied through this platform

### Portals I truly hated

<Accordion type="single" collapsible>
<AccordionItem value="turing">
<AccordionTrigger>
<div className="flex items-center gap-2 mb-2 mt-4"><MdxAvatar src="https://turing.com/favicon.ico" name="Turing" /><span>Turing</span></div>

<AccordionContent className="text-lg">
<a href="https://turing.com" target="_blank" className="flex gap-2 items-center my-4"><ExternalLinkIcon /><span>Website</span></a>
I don't know what to say. I've registered to Turing, too, and I absolutely hate it.

<MdxPanel>
**Cons**

- they measure your competency score based on their quizes, which are ridiculously bad, simply outdated and mostly irrelevant
- you don't get to see any jobs after you register, complete your profile, pass screening and take the coding challenges. you have to be "shortlisted" for a job, whatever that means
- they advertise themselves as the platform of high paying US jobs
- no transparency on how things work
- i think their AI has automatically overwritten bits of my profile
- annoying profile prompts
- more annoying whatsapp messages from their bot
- honestly, I'm just annoyed at this point

</MdxPanel>

</AccordionContent>
</AccordionItem>

<AccordionItem value="landing">
<AccordionTrigger>
<div className="flex items-center gap-2 mb-2 mt-4"><MdxAvatar src="https://landing.jobs/favicon.ico" name="Landing Jobs" /><span>Landing Jobs</span></div>
</AccordionTrigger>
<AccordionContent className="text-lg">
<a href="https://landing.jobs" target="_blank" className="flex gap-2 items-center my-4"><ExternalLinkIcon /><span>Website</span></a>

I remember when they launched like 8-9 years ago, I found it really exciting. During the registration they seem to ask a lot of irrelevant questions. Their processes are encouraging employers to declare hard requirements, so if you have 7 years of experience, but a posting happens to require 8, you can not apply. I don't know how I feel about that (I do, but that would be a separate blog post I guess).

I opened their site regularly last summer, and I remember there was always the same two job postings hanging around for months. One of the companies reached out to me, and when I accepted their initiative (on the same day), they turned me down 10 days later without any explanation. I think the platform has confusing processes which are hard to make sense of as an outsider.

One more thing: I also got a call from one of their staff, wanting to gather more information about me to be able to provide a better service. Oh, how nice, I thought, then she basically went over the same exact questions I needed to fill out during the registration. I feel bad for the person who needed to do that as her job, but I really, really want that half an hour back to my life.

<MdxPanel>
**Cons**
- bad UI/UX (I know this can be subjective sometimes)
- tedious onboarding
- not a lot of jobs
- lots of tedious rules and metrics
- it feels like they don't really know what they are doing
- more, than half of the jobs don't have salary ranges, and the ones that do, are usually below the market average, based on my impression

I don't really know how things work here. I completed a [take home task](https://github.com/vacuumdreams/test_vending-machine) some time ago, had a call with a person then who approved me. Their job board is empty ever since, but they rebuilt / redesigned the platform a few times.

### Portals which left me meh

I've registered to all of these, but I refuse to writee about them individually. They either have meh UX, not a lot of jobs, or they just simply don't offer much, and do that in a spectacularly boring way:

</div>

Obviously, I'm on [Linkedin](https://linkedin.com/in/botondfekete) and [Indeed](https://indeed.com), too, and that's still where I find the most postings, as they are the most mainstream options out there to this day.

### What's next?

Well, I'm not sure how broken the hiring industry is, I don't have enough insight into all this, and specially behind the stage. Even a friend of mine created his own job portal (<a className="inline-flex gap-2 items-baseline" href="https://moonka.space" target="_blank"><MdxAvatar className="w-4 h-4" src="https://moonka.space/favicon.ico" name="Moonka" /><span>Moonka</span></a>) to address his annoyance towards the state of HR, and try to create something better. For me this is a clear indication that things are in a stage where everyone is creating different solutions to disrupt the crap out of the industry, because things are simply not working well. Maybe something truly revolutionary will come along which will give us a new extraordinary framework. Maybe we're forever stuck with the pain of our bleeding organs.

On the other hand I can relate to the struggles of many. It's hard to know where to improve, what adjustments to make. Should I memorize SQL queries? Should I get back to practicing algorythms and other stuff I'd never ever have to use when solving real-life problems, so I can finally pass my final exam with <a className="inline-flex gap-2 items-baseline" href="https://toptal.com" target="_blank"><MdxAvatar className="w-4 h-4" src="https://frontier-assets.toptal.com/1a81142b763d22a6d22d.png" name="Toptal" /><span>Toptal</span></a>, get the validation what I'm looking for since my father first shouted at me that I'm finally not wasting my life, and live happily ever after?

Keeping the hundreds of rejection emails from no-reply addresses and the constant ghosting out of your head is a challenging task. I know one thing, I am a problem solver, I always was, and if my purpose as a software engineer expired, I will find my peace with that. I will probably look elsewhere eventually and keep coding as a hobby. I haven't always done programming as a job. Letting go of 10 years worth of experience and the identity built around it is not going to be easy, but I do have the ambition to function as a human being, as someone who can be useful for their surrounding society and find purpose in what they're doing.

### No, really, what's next?

If / when I get desperate enough, the next thing I might try out is probably <a className="inline-flex gap-2 items-baseline" href="https://loopcv.pro" target="_blank"><MdxAvatar className="w-4 h-4" src="https://loopcv.pro/favicon.ico" name="Loop CV" /><span>Loop CV</span></a>, once I figure out how to comply with their ridiculous max file size limit of 1MB for my uploadables. They promise to auto-apply to jobs for you, this is like a Tinder bot which would swipe right day and night, but for, well, jobs. Sounds dangerous, but I guess horniness makes everyone stupid. So as not being able to pay the bills. Curious to see if this gets me "laid".

Well, good luck to all of us, burned out and frustrated individuals. I hope we all find our ways out from this overwhelming mess.

<p className="p-2 mt-8 border border-muted-foreground text-muted-foreground">Update: I've ended up trying LoopCV. It was ridiculously bad for a paid service, essentially every job match was pulled in from Workable, the auto-apply feature didn't work, the UX was confusing, and I did not get anything out of it at all. This one sadly doesn't get a recommendation.</p>
