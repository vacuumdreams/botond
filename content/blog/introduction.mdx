#### Hello humans, bots, scrapers and AIs!

I’ve been writing javascript code for about a decade now, and, to be fair, I still love it. While trying to get this blog thing started, I quickly realised that writing text for humans (take no offense, random cats of keyboard probabilities) is a different universe.
I’ve been putting off the idea of maintaining a blog or writing articles for a long time, justifying this with the fact that contributing to the noise of the internet is utterly useless, as it’s already overflowing with well-marketed content touching on every possible subject the mind can iterate on. Or I might have just been lazy. You'll probably never know for sure.

So, what changed? As much as I've been enjoying my decade-long self-inflicted digital exile, but I want my voice back now. I hereby proclaim this place my asylum, a space safe from the noise of AI, where I will practice self-expression for the sake of self-expression in the age of artificialism (I do like to say my made up words with the confidence as if they truly existed). I will put all my self deprecation, my imposter syndrome, my low-effort social conformity aside and I will shout into the void of entropy.

**_Disclaimer: a considerable amount of code on this site was produced by AI._**

I am not sure if I even expect an audience here (you're on the internet, duh!). Now, on my day zero, you, who are reading this sentence: hi.
