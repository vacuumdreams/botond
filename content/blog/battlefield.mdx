I never had problems looking for a job before in my life. I am on the hunt for about a year now. I managed to luckily land a part-time freelance gig last autumn, which was very undemanding, uninspiring, therefore also quite unsatisfying. It definitely felt like a huge downgrade from what I was used to before, but I was happy I had a temporary revenue stream, but that ended a while ago now.

A few weeks ago a good friend of mine reached out if I want to come on board with them for a little bit and get their webapp into a better shape. I didn't realise how broken I was by then. On my first day with them at I went to the toilet and I started to cry while I was peeing. This kind of multitasking has very uncomfrotable logistical consequences, which I will not go into now. My proud grandfathers, who fought in wars and whatnot and have never seen a tear in their lives, were rolling in their graves at this point, so I stopped sobbing and flushed. I haven't felt this much gratitude for a long time, and it felt incredible, hopeful and bright.

I wish I had an inspiring conclusion to wrap this up with, like you just need to hold in there, buddy, the universe is busy right now, but it is going to be all okay.
