So, I decided to do a second round to [The Hunt](/blog/the-hunt). The initial post ended up being heavily themed around how I experience the state of the job market, and turned it into platform reviews for the second half. I made a few observations since then, and I just can't seem to keep them to myself.

#### The minefield of the CV writing

If you looked around on your Linkedin feed lately, you might have noticed the amount of experts giving out free advice on how to be awesome. Is very easy, really: since applying to jobs is a number game, you have to make sure you send out as many applications as humanly possible, while making sure you carefully read through the specs, modify your CV to match each job description, formulate a cover letter where you highlight your awesomeness, making sure you mention your burning urge to join their team, but also cut to the chase, because who are you to demand an extra few seconds from whoever ends up reading your monologue of rambling nonsense. Next up, make sure your CV complies the size limits of certain platforms (pro tip: you will have to make sure it's below 1MB). Make sure you use bullet points, but not too many bullet points, add all the possible keywords for what might be relevant to the job, but not too many keywords, while making sure you inject your personality to it so that they can all see how you stand out. Simple enough. You still don't get it, do you? Let me lay it out for you with them bullet points we just talked about:

- do yourself a favor, and be fast, send out a lot of applications to get noticed
- send only personalized, quality applications to get noticed
- learn about the systems recruiters use and make sure your layout doesn't kill their vibe to get noticed
- learn how AI analyses your information, and make sure it agrees on the fact that you are the most awesome human born to this planet to get noticed
- don't be a bitch, just make it easy for everybody on the hiring end, and
- now you're ready to stand out, so just stand out


stats from the past few weeks - me getting noticed:
- recruiters reaching out to me on Linkedin: 3
- me applying to jobs on Linkedin: 2
- anything else: 0
