I love the city. I always find being surrounded by a large variety of people, events, and random sights inspiring. We recently had to move out, because we could no longer affort to live there. We moved to the South, across the river, to a sleepy small town, where the water smells like sewage, and people tend to drink cheap double whisky with their morning espresso.

I never had problems looking for a job before in my life. In the past year I was constantly on the hunt. I managed to luckily land a part-time job, which was very undemanding and uninspiring, therefore also quite unsatisfying. It definitely felt like a huge downgrade from what I was used to, but I was grateful I had a temporary revenue stream.

I few weeks ago a good friend of mine reached out if I want to come on board with them and do a little consultancy to get their webapp into a better shape. I didn't realise how broken I was by this point, on my first day with them at one point I went to the toilet and I started to cry while I was peeing. This kind of multitasking has very uncomfrotable logistical consequences for any penis owner, which I will not go into now. I felt like my proud grandfathers, who fought in wars and never seen a tear in their lives were rolling in their graves, so I stopped sobbing and flushed. I was filled with gratitude and hope again, and it felt incredible.

I'm going to make this awkward and continue it as a tech post from here, no matter how strange the transition is.
