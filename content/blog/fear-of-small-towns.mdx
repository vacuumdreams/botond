I love the city. I have always found being surrounded by this wide range of social and architectural pseudo-randomness very inspiring. The buzz, the ideas, the lights, the concept that everything is within my reach come with reassuring comfort and a sense of participating in something meaningful.

We have recently moved to a small town. We could no longer support ourselves financially in the city, from only one part-time salary, with no job security and without the prospect of being able to land a position after trying continuously for more than a year. This sleepy town lays on the south side of the river, where the streets smell like sewage, and people tend to drink cheap double whisky with their morning espresso. This is a place where nothing ever happens. I find it impossible not to notice how people display classic small-town features, like rushing down the main street full throttle or turning up a favorite 90's hit to the max for the neighbourhood on an otherwise quiet and meaningless Sunday morning.

I grew up in a small town. I remember how much I hated it. I hated the stares, the clumsy exhibit of self-importance, the implementation of brute attention seeking strategies. How could I possibly find a way to belong? I couldn't. I have moved out when I turned 18, and never looked back. The painful associations now come rushing back as bitter reminders of what I was trying to escape from.

I fear getting habituated into this impulseless space. I fear I will go nuts one day in my slowly increasing loneliness. I fear I am losing my drive, my motivation, my sense of purpose as the horizon narrows. I despise my arrogance and for judging this observed habitat and thinking I am above all this pettiness. I despise my envy toward the people who belong. I despise my fear and self-pity of all the despise.

The adjustment curve of this new reality is steep like a freefall, but humans adapt. I am a human, and this is a syllogism.
