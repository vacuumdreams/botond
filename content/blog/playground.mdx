I remember the rise of typescript back in the days. The thing which always turned me off about it, specially for smaller frontend projects which interacted with a lot of services outside your control, that you had to manually type out and then maintain every single data type which was coming into your system from your all your APIs and some of the third party libraries which didn't provide you with it, which meant you were destined to get false positives whenever things changed outside your system, making it very non-intuitive to debug.

I believe for me the real game changer was when I came across [OpenAPI](https://www.openapis.org/). There was a lot of tooling available, all sorts of code generators (for tests, mocks, type definitions for different languages). In case you're not familiar with it, OpenAPI is an initiative to standardize RESTful APIs, to provide a language agnostic way to precisely describe them. This was growingly useful in the microservice architectures, where you had dozens of APIs, the these specs were there to document interactions and data structures coming in and out from your APIs.

Shortly after I went through this enlightenment, [Orval](https://orval.dev/) came out and simplified things even more. It gave you a fully typed client library with a variety of outputs you could choose from, e.g. [React Query](https://react-query.tanstack.com/). I felt like REST APIs were finally just as pleasant to use on the frontend as GraphQL was with its schemas and client generators, but without the problems of GraphQL, about which I will gracefully shut up in this post.

So, we're iterating enlightenments, the next one I wanted to mention is [trpc](https://trpc.io/). I came across this last year, and quickly gave it a go. Having typescript code in all directions really does magic, code generation becomes obsolete. It's pretty neat that you get instant feedback on the changes in your data structure. What it essentially gives you is a router for your backend and one for your frontend, which would both feed on the same data source, and then you can use an adapter to hook it into pretty much any node based service (node, express, fastify, etc). It uses a lot of concepts borrowed from GraphQL clients, like naming conventions for requests (queries, mutations, subscriptions), using links to fetch data, and so on.

Okay, we're finally arriving to the actual topic of the post.

### The actual topic of the post

Told you.

I made two discoveries relatively recently, and as a result I officially entered my post-trpc era.

### The first discovery

This is [Drizzle](https://orm.drizzle.team), which prides itself as a [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/) alternative, but without the code generation and the special schema language, as it's all typescript, baby! The ORM part of it also feels closer to actual SQL, which took a little to get used to again, but I think it's a great thing. It's definitely less rouboust than Prisma ( which btw just recently announced [Pulse](https://www.prisma.io/data-platform/pulse), which looks pretty awesome).

### The second discovery

The second thing I stumbled upon was [Elysia](https://elysiajs.com), and I thought I give it a try. As you can tell from the long ass intro, this post is going to be more about the developer experience rather than how fast it is, you can find plenty of benchmarks online for that. It definitely took a few minutes to get over its logo, which essentially resembles a monochromatic version of the Firefox logo from the early 2000s.

On the front page you can see with big letters: "Ergonomic Framework for Humans". As a human, I was already intrigued.

<p className="text-muted-foreground">(Fun fact: while writing this post, Elysia v1.0 was released ðŸŽ‰)</p>

### Code, give me code. Now!

Wait for it!

If you ever used [Fastify](https://fastify.dev), the route handlers in Elysia will feel familiar in terms of validation - Fastify does it with Json Schema, Elysia uses [Typebox](https://github.com/sinclairzx81/typebox).

I'm not going to go into the details on how to set up a database, what to do with your connection URI, because it would make a ridiculously long post. Instead, I'll try to present the simplicity of passing around data in a few steps.

_1. The database_

Going with a simple initializer based on the [docs](https://orm.drizzle.team/docs/get-started-postgresql#postgresjs) for Drizzle's Postgres adapter:

```ts title="src/lib/db/index.ts"
import { drizzle } from "drizzle-orm/postgres-js"
import postgres from "postgres"

const connectionString = String(process.env.DATABASE_URL)

const sql = postgres(connectionString)
export const db = drizzle(sql)
```

Then we'll need a dummy table:

```ts title="src/lib/db/schema.ts"
import { pgTable, text, timestamp } from "drizzle-orm/pg-core"

export const resourceTable = pgTable("resource", {
  id: text("id").primaryKey(),
  createdAt: timestamp("created_at", {
    withTimezone: true,
    mode: "date",
  }).notNull(),
  updatedAt: timestamp("created_at", {
    withTimezone: true,
    mode: "date",
  }).notNull(),
  value: text("value"),
})
```

_2. The service_

So, a few things here: [drizzle-typebox](https://orm.drizzle.team/docs/typebox) is a handy library to grab the table definition and create a validation schema, which Elysia can just pick up. Going to create two endpoints, one for getting the list of resources, and one for inserting a new one.

```ts title="src/api/index.ts"
import { Elysia, t } from "elysia"
import { createSelectSchema, createInsertSchema } from "drizzle-typebox"
import { resourceTable } from "../lib/db/schema"

export const schemas = {
  resource: {
    select: createSelectSchema(resourceTable),
    insert: createInsertSchema(resourceTable),
  },
}

export const api = new Elysia({ prefix: "/api" })
  .get(
    "/resource",
    () => {
      return db.select().from(resourceTable)
    },
    {
      response: {
        body: t.Array(selectSchema),
      },
    }
  )
  .post(
    "resource",
    async (req) => {
      const [res] = await db.insert(resourceTable).values(req.body).returning()
      return res
    },
    {
      body: insertSchema,
      response: selectSchema,
    }
  )
  .listen(3001)

export type Api = typeof api
```

I'm sorry if I offend you with the lack of semicolons (translation: I'm not sorry, I'm being cynical). On semicolons, I totally agree with [Vonnegut](https://www.grammarbook.com/blog/commas/the-man-who-hated-semicolons/), even though I'd probably leave off the "transvestite hermaphrodites" part. Wtf Kurt?

_3. The frontend_

So, Im going to go back to use the good old [react-query](https://tanstack.com/query/v4/docs/framework/react/overview) for my example, combined with Elysia's [eden](https://elysiajs.com/eden/overview.html) library for the client, and [react-hook-form](https://www.react-hook-form.com) combined with a typebox resolver to process the validation schema we previously created for the backend above. For a very dummy CR~~UD~~ interface, to display the list of resources and be able to add new ones, I could do something like:

```tsx title="src/app/resource.tsx"
import { useForm } from "react-hook-form"
import { typeboxResolver } from "@hookform/resolvers/typebox"
import { useQuery, useMutation } from "@tanstack/react-query"
import { treaty } from "@elysiajs/eden"
import { schemas } from "../api"
import type { Api } from "../api"

const client = treaty<Api>("http://localhost:3001")

export const Resource = () => {
  const { data, refetch } = useQuery({
    queryKey: ["resources"],
    queryFn: () => client.resource.get(),
  })
  const { mutate } = useMutation({
    mutationFn: (args: Parameters<typeof client.resource.post>) => {
      return client.resource.post(args)
    },
    onSuccess: () => refetch(),
  })
  const { register, handleSubmit } = useForm({
    resolver: typeboxResolver(schemas.resource.insert),
  })

  return (
    <div>
      <ul>
        {data?.map((resource) => <li key={resource.id}>{resource.value}</li>)}
      </ul>
      <form onSubmit={handleSubmit(mutate)}>
        <input
          {...register("value")}
          type="text"
          placeholder="New Resource Value"
        />
      </form>
    </div>
  )
}
```

For this example this might look like an overkill, but this is something I imagine a real world application would look like.

Finally finishing off with setting up the query provider:

```tsx title="src/app/index.tsx"
import { QueryClient, QueryClientProvider } from "@tanstack/react-query"
import { Resource } from "./resource"

const queryClient = new QueryClient()

const App = () => {
  return (
    <QueryClientProvider client={queryClient}>
      <Resource />
    </QueryClientProvider>
  )
}
```

### Summary

So, as you can see above, you can have a fully type-safe application from database to frontend without having to write a single type definition, which for me is super exciting to think of. I've created a repo to show all this in action, plus I've tried a few extra things in there, like using Elysia as a resolver for a Next.js app's endpoints, added shadcn/ui for the frontend, etc. You can check it out on <span className="bg-primary-foreground inline-block">[-> this link](https://github.com/vacuumdreams/test_elysia)</span>.

### Final notes

So, what's up? Is code generation obsolete?

Well, pretty much with everything, code generation has its place. Code generators can be super useful for handling boilerplate, without adding complexity (boilerplate is usually easy to understand, some abstractions not so much), without compromising performance (they usually don't execute on runtime), without hiding logic (the output is usually part of your codebase).

For example, if the code above was to serve some mid-large scale production app, I'd love to write a code generator which would take a drizzle table name as an input, and generate the CRUD endpoints into my Elysia API, and my react-query handlers for the frontend.

There are popular libraries out there, shadcn/ui, for example is just a code generator, and most people love the control they get out from the output, and not having to deal with third party code, waiting for releases to get things fixed, and so on.

Code generators are awesome. Drizzle's awesome. Elysia's awesome. You are awesome. Until next time.
